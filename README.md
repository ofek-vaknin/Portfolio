# Portfolio
This is my first personal project, where I dive into web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The portfolio highlights my personal skills, creativity, and strong motivation to learn and grow as a developer.
It represents my first step into the world of design and coding, and marks the beginning of my professional journey.
